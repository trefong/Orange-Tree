# Orange-Tree

###A sample of a small program that creates virtual orange trees and can determine if the tree is mature, dead, or has oranges. You can "pick" the oranges from the tree and add another year to its' life. Spec tests were written to ensure that the program was running smoothly while implementing other features.
